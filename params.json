The Stopbleed extension will be the Alpha release of the next version.  Google Chrome Store was holding the original extension for review. We are trying to resolve this issue.  \r\n[Chromebleed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebleed/eeoekjnjgppnaegdjbcafdggilajhpic) version 2.0.0  \r\n[Stopbleed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopbleed/okdekadbjjhbnlmldheinccioijofhgc) Version 2.2.0 (Alpha)  \r\n\r\n##What does this do?\r\nMany HTTPS-secured sites on the internet use OpenSSL. Unfortunately, a major vulnerability in OpenSSL was disclosed - known as the Heartbleed bug - yesterday that put hundreds of thousands of servers at risk of compromise.  \r\n\r\nWhilst some servers have been patched already, many remain that have not been patched. Chromebleed uses a web service developed by [Filippo Valsorda](https://filippo.io/Heartbleed/) and checks the URL of the page you have just loaded. The repository code for the service is hosted [here on Github](https://github.com/FiloSottile/Heartbleed) also. \r\n\r\nWhen you browse to a domain affected by Heartbleed, then a Chrome notification will be displayed. It's as simple as that!  \r\n\r\n**Gremlins exist** - this was developed rather late at night. Bugs will exist somewhere!  \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome to help [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) and improve this project.
